  "title": "About Me",
  "p1": "Hey, I'm William Estrada — a Senior Software Engineer with a soft spot for the future.",
  "p2": "My love for sci-fi is what first pulled me toward technology, and I’ve been building software ever since, always fascinated by what’s possible when imagination meets engineering.",
  "p3": "I specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript, AWS, and Go, and I've been developing software professionally since 2019. Over the years, I’ve worked across mobile, backend, and cloud-native systems — from refactoring legacy codebases to architecting scalable, high-performance applications from scratch. I’m particularly proud of my deep experience with AWS, backed by multiple certifications and countless real-world deployments.",
  "p4": "Beyond engineering, I’m passionate about teaching. Right now, I’m preparing courses focused on professional-level JavaScript, aimed at helping developers level up with real-world patterns, architecture, and industry practices.",
  "p5": "When I’m not building something (or breaking something to learn from it), you’ll probably find me experimenting with small projects across different tech stacks — it keeps me sharp and satisfies my love for learning.",
  "p6": "Outside of tech, I’m basically a one-man band. I play guitar, bass, and drums, switching between them depending on the mood. And if I'm not making noise, I’m usually cooking, skateboarding, or diving back into the worlds of my favorite sci-fi stories.",
  "p7": "If you’d like to chat about futuristic ideas, clean code, or want to work together — I’m available for freelance projects and collaborations.",
  "contact": "Reach me anytime at will@futuriza.me"
